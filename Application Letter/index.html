	<h2>Application to join Frontend Team</h2>
	
	<p>I write to apply to join one of the Frontend Teams in the ongoing <a href="https://internship.zuri.team">Zuri Internship Programme.</a> I am a newbie frontend developer who is genuinely hungry for knowledge. Having come across Zuri platform in my curious search for the right learning platform, I feel much happy to have found a place where I can collaborate with great minds and drink from their cups of knowledge.</p>
	
	<p>Even though I have no background in computer science or any related course, I am not only hopeful, but also very determined to make a headway and excel in this new area, with the right mentorship I believe will be offered this unique platform. This is also bouyed by my passion for digital technology which I have found very useful and efficient in taking my primary career - teaching - to a whole new level.</p>

	<p>My journey into web development started with my free WordPress blog<a href="https://www.taofeekajibade.wordpress.com"> taofeekajibade.wordpress.com</a> started for fun in 2014 and which I still for blogging till date. I have since added some new trainings - mostly self-taught - using online resources. The experience gained so far has enabled me to design a<a href="https://cleargoaldigital.github.io"> personal rookie website</a> from scratch and host it on github. It has also given me the confidence to apply for this internship, hoping to gain much better knowledge that would help refine my skills and make me a consummate frontend developer.</p>
	
	<p>I would be glad if I can be considered for a place in the keenly contested slots for Team selection.</p>
	
	<p>Thank you for your anticipated kind consideration.</p>
